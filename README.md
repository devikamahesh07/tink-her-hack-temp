Project Description

A clean, reminder-based habit tracker website that helps users track daily routines, build consistency, monitor progress, and stay motivated with streaks, rewards, and insights.

Problem Statement

People struggle to maintain healthy habits because they lack a structured way to track routines, forget to complete tasks, and don’t receive feedback or motivational insights.

Solution

A habit tracker website that allows users to add habits, track progress, view streaks, receive reminders, track moods, enable Focus Mode, start challenges, and earn rewards—all saved locally for persistence.
